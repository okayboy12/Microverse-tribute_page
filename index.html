      <li><a href="#" target="_blank" id="tribute-link"><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science. </a></li>

      <li><a href="#" target="_blank" id="tribute-link"><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.

      <li><a href="#" target="_blank" id="tribute-link"><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</a></li>
      <li><a href="#" target="_blank" id="tribute-link"><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat. </a></li>
